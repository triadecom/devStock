## DevStock service

DevStock - it's a something like a your personal "stock" for all of your <br>
important things, like a projects, designs, notes, and etc.<br>

I decided to create this project a quite recently,<br>
so informative and maybe useful notes will be later in updates<br>


## Project aims

I hope, that this service will make life and work flows more organized and productive.<br>
Second aim is just a grow up to full stack developer, be more independent with some ideas.<br>

Also, this project is also will help me to more practice in popular libraries/frameworks, such like an react, vue and many different<br>
So, now you should understand, that this project, in fact will be more like an self-study thing, unlike a real project

### Actual project progress

At this moment, I haven't something to show.<br>
`Develop in progress!`

### Project main features

**Feature list will be growing by the time**<br>

1. Comfortable interaction with projects
2. Good 'Project' meaning in service
3. Way to make some usable files cloud system, or working with one of existing
4. Smart and thoroughly planned UI/UX side, that will help own users with understanding of priorities
5. Safe and secure system, that will make service more private, unlike an social network or something like this.
6. System, that understand projects work-flow and trying to be more comfort and adaptive for user
7. Some simple organizer apps
8. Useful way to show your works, something like portfolio, adaptive to all professions
9. Some utility features that will make own projects analysis easier
10. Being more accurate and useful for all users. <br>
(Alpha-version will be adapted only for me, but in Beta-version I planning to make it work with Users,
 doing some researches and some of like this analysis things)

I really hope that final version will be equal or just very close with this list,<br>
But also I'm sure that this version is just like one out of different levels of project evolution in future<br>

### Project expectations

At this moment, I can just imagine of future features and lifecycle of service but all.<br>
But I can list some things, that I can imagine as appropriate evolution ways of project<br>

1. Mobile version for service
2. Android client-server app
3. IOS client-server app
4. Desktop version, exclusively on MacOs <br> (Apps like this a very unpopular in any other OS)<br>
`This list will be editing in future`

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
